TriggerEvent('wl-alerts:civilian:notify', 'Suspicious')

You Trigger that event (wl-alerts:civilian:notify) from whichever script you wish to use to send a notification to the police.
For example, I am triggering "Suspicious" which then goes to: dispatchCode = '10-10'
Inside the database table, there is a code which is labelled as "10-10" that is the data that will be sent to the client.
If you wish to be able to use more codes, you must add another table entry to the database and restart the script, this is to ensure maximum performance
You DO NOT have to use the word "Suspicious" as long as the keyword you use has something inside the other event; IE

TriggerEvent('wl-alerts:civilian:notify', 'KappaPride123')

INSIDE THE EVENT (wl-alerts:civilian:notify) YOU CREATE ANOTHER if ENTRY

    if alertType == "KappaPride123" and not popo then
        data = {dispatchCode = '10-11', street = playerStreetsLocation}
        TriggerServerEvent('wf-alerts:svNotify', data)
    end

And just like that, you're done.
